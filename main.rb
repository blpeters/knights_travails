# frozen_string_literal: true

# knights travails
# 
# pseudocode:
# GOAL: output the shortest path for a knight to get from one square to another, listing the squares it takes along the way.
# put together a script that creates a game board and a knight
# Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree.
# Don't allow any moves to go off the board.
# Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. One of them could be a potentially infinite series.
# Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output the full path.
